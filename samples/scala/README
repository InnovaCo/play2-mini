PLAY AS AN HTTP LIBRARY
-----------------------
this project demonstrates how play scales down by allowing users to utilize play as an HTTP layer in existing, vanilla sbt project (or maven).

(Notice: there is nothing play specific about this project, no app, conf folder.)

------------------
HOW TO RUN THE APP 
------------------

this app requires the latest version of play (not available in a repo yet),
the easiest way to setup this demo is by installing play 2.0 https://github.com/playframework/Play20

and then

$ sbt -Dsbt.ivy.home=/myplay2installation/repository

> run
